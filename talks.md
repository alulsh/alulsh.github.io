### Intro to Git + Build Your Own Website with GitHub Pages and Cloud9

[Slides](https://slides.com/alexandraulsh)

Hour long interactive workshop that first teaches attendees the basics of git and GitHub and then dives in to how to create your own personal website using GitHub Pages and [Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io/). I chose Cloud9 IDE for this presentation as I wanted to ensure that any attendee regardless of what device they own (e.g. old Windows laptop, Chromebook, or tablet) or have access to (library computer) could learn git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages.
