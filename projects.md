### Security

#### Personal Security Checklist

[GitHub](https://github.com/alulsh/personal-security-checklist)

After leading my first Intro to Security for Developers workshop I realized my attendees felt a little overwhelmed and fearful instead of empowered. They didn't know where to start in how to secure their own personal accounts and devices. 

I made this checklist so that people would have a hit list of actions they could take immediately after a digital security training. Though the checklist is hosted on GitHub it's not targeted at only developers. I list what I believe are the security essentials that everyone regardless of their job or threat model should configure.

#### Intro to Security for Developers

[Slides](https://www.alexandraulsh.com/intro-to-security-for-developers/slides/#/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/alulsh/personal-security-checklist)

I created this two hour long workshop as we had a lot of great developer tech talks at Women Who Code DC but none that focused on web application security. I wanted to distil what I had learned after my first year of Mapbox into a workshop with code samples that people could refer to later as a reference. The presentation has a special focus on Node.js since that's what I use at Mapbox.

### Volunteer + Meetups

Here are some organizations I volunteer with or Meetups I attend:

* [Women Who Code DC](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/)
* [DCFemTech](https://dcfemtech.github.io/) and [DCFemTech Hack for Good](https://dcfemtech.github.io/hackforgood)
* [Code for DC](https://codefordc.org/)
  * I haven't been to this in a long time due to personal bandwidth and I'm looking for more contributors to take over the [WABA Bike Map project](https://github.com/dcfemtech/hackforgood-waba-map). Please contact me if you're interested.

### Personal

#### DC Tech Women and Enby Websites

[Site](https://www.alexandraulsh.com/DC-Tech-Women-And-NB-Websites/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/alulsh/DC-Tech-Women-And-NB-Websites)

I created this project in 2015 when I was putting together my personal website for the first time. I realized there were lots of awesome women and enbies ([non-binary people](https://www.transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-non-binary-people-how-to-be-respectful-and-supportive)) in DCTech who also happened to have awesome personal websites. I wanted to gather them all and share them with the world to inspire others and showcase their accomplishments! This project could use some serious updating - please [open a new issue](https://github.com/alulsh/DC-Tech-Women-And-NB-Websites/issues) or submit a new pull request.

#### Military Brat Map

I get asked a lot where I'm from. Given I'm a military brat, it's much easier to explain with a map. At Mapbox everyone has to make a map as part of onboarding and this is what I made. I would love to upgrade it from [mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/) to [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) sometime.
