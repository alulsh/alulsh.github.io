## JavaScript Study Guide

### What is JavaScript?

### What tools do I need?
Just like with HTML and CSS, all you need is a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit) and a web browser! Nevertheless, as you write more complex JavaScript you may find it difficult to write code and debug with only basic text editors. Advanced text editors, browser tools (for debugging), and online integrated development environments (IDEs) make coding JavaScript and squashing bugs easier.

#### Advanced Text Editors
These programs feature productivity-enhancing features such as syntax highlighting, line numbering, and multiple tabs.

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (Mac, Windows, and Linux)
* [Komodo Edit](http://komodoide.com/komodo-edit/) (Mac, Windows, and Linux)
* [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows)

#### Browser Tools
All popular web browsers come with built in [developer consoles](http://wickedlysmart.com/hfjsconsole/) and tools for debugging. 

* Chrome: [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) (“DevTools”)
* Firefox: [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) - Note: you do not need to download the Firefox Developer Edition for these tools
* Safari: [Web Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/)
* Internet Explorer: [F12 Developer Tools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/bg182326(v=vs.85))

#### Shells and Online IDEs
Shells allow you to quickly write and test JavaScript code without having to save files locally. They allow you to easily send and share links to your work with others. Cloud or online IDEs allow you to write and debug JavaScript from any device, which is especially useful if you have multiple computers.

* [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) - Shell - Save “fiddles” and share with permalinks
* [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/) - Shell - Save work, share links, embed bins on webpages, and view codecasts
* [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) - Shell
* [Koding](https://koding.com/) - IDE
* [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) - IDE
