After leading my first Intro to Security for Developers workshop, I noticed my attendees felt worried and overwhelmed afterwards instead of empowered. They didn't know where to start in securing their personal accounts and devices. 

My personal security checklist is a list of next actions that attendees can immediately complete after a digital security training. Though the checklist is on GitHub it's not targeted at only developers. I list what I believe are the security essentials that everyone regardless of their job or threat model should configure.

I gave a quick presentation on my personal security checklist at [Round 41: Polka Sprockets](https://dc.hackandtell.org/2017/02/16/round-41.html) of [DC Hack and Tell](https://dc.hackandtell.org/) on [February 16th, 2017](https://twitter.com/uncompiled/status/832380649713631232?s=20).
