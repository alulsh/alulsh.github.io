I started a genealogy hobby in late 2019 and was frustrated by the lack of easy and useful mapping tools in the ecosystem. I didn't want to manually geocode and verify every location in my family tree, and I didn't want to maintain and upload multiple copies of my family tree across different services. I created the [Family Tree Map](https://www.alexandraulsh.com/family-tree-map/) tool so I could quickly geocode a GEDCOM export of my entire family tree in a couple clicks.
