{% include project_base.html %}

I created this project in 2015 when I set up my personal website for the first time. For inspiration, I looked at the personal websites of other people I knew or heard about in DCTech. I open sourced my list to increase the representation of gender minorities in DCTech and to encourage other underrepresented folks to create personal websites. [We Speak Too](http://wespeaktoo.org/) offers a similar list if you're interested in finding gender minority speakers!
