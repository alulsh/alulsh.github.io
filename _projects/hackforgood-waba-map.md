I was one of the event organizers for the 2016 DCFemTech [Hack for Good](http://dcfemtech.com/hackforgood) and the project lead for [WABA (Washington Area Bicyclist Association) bike map project](https://github.com/dcfemtech/hackforgood-waba-map) at the hackathon. Within 12 hours over 2 days, I rallied a group of 7 other technologists to produce an [interactive web map](https://dcfemtech.com/hackforgood-waba-map/) showing official bicycle infrastructure and 500 ft, 2500 ft, 1000 ft, and 1 mile [buffers](https://turfjs.org/docs/#buffer) in the Washington D.C. area. This map helps WABA determine which parts of the region aren't within 1 mile of official bicycle infrastructure and where they should invest their advocacy. After Hack for Good, I transitioned the project to [Code for DC](https://codefordc.org/), growing the project to [13 total contributors](https://github.com/dcfemtech/hackforgood-waba-map/graphs/contributors).
