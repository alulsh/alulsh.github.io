{% include project_base.html %}

I originally created this project in February 2018 to visualize service availability for DC's [2017-2018 dockless bicycles pilot program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-09/d-c-s-dockless-bikeshare-firms-earn-more-diverse-users). I [presented my work](https://mobilitylab.org/2018/02/20/digging-data-dockless-shared-bike-systems/) at [Bikeshare Hack Night VIII](https://www.meetup.com/Transportation-Techies/events/245353650/) of the Transportation Techies Meetup. The [July 2018 exit of most DC dockless bicycle providers](https://ggwash.org/view/69307/who-killed-dcs-dockless-pedal-bicycles) and [JUMP disabling CORS on their public API endpoint](https://github.com/alulsh/dc-micromobility-by-neighborhood/issues/7) broke this project. In 2021 I renamed this project from dc-bikeshare-by-neighborhood to dc-micromobility-by-neighborhood and added all DC e-scooter API endpoints with CORS.
