"Where are you from?" is a hard question to answer as a [military brat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_brat_(U.S._subculture)) and [adult third culture kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid). I don't have a hometown, so I usually share a few of the places I grew up. At Mapbox, everyone used to make a map as an onboarding project. I made this map as my onboarding project so I could show people a map when they asked me, "Where are you from?"
