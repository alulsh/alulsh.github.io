November 1, 2017 - Launching a bug bounty program is hard. Running and maintaining a successful bug bounty program is even harder. Using real-world stories of both failure and success, I describe how I used tools, processes, automation, and empathy to decrease response time by 90%, reduce noise, and improve average report quality for [Mapbox's bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/mapbox?type=team). 

While [O'Reilly canceled all future conferences](https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/) after COVID-19, this presentation is still available in their online learning platform. I have the rights to upload my presentation to Youtube and display it on my website.
