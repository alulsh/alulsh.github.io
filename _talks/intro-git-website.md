Hour long interactive workshop that teaches attendees git, GitHub, and creating your personal website using GitHub Pages and [Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io/). I chose Cloud9 IDE so that any attendee regardless of device (e.g., old Windows laptop, Chromebook, tablet, library computer, etc.) could learn git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages. [AWS acquired Cloud9 in July 2016](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/14/amazons-aws-buys-cloud9-to-add-more-development-tools-to-its-web-services-stack/), so this service now requires an AWS account and is no longer free.
