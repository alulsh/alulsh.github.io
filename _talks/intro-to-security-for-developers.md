Two hour long interactive workshop with Node.js code samples for full stack developers. Topics include secure use of GitHub and npm, HTTPS, cross site scripting (XSS), designing authentication systems, information disclosure, protecting availability, and security HTTP headers. This workshops distills what I learned after my first year as an Information Security Engineer at Mapbox, primarily working in Node.js.
